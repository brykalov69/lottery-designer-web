    <h1>Stop letting a machine pick your lottery numbers.</h1>

    <p class="muted">
      Most lottery tickets today are generated in one click —
      fast, random, and opaque.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t know why these numbers were chosen.
      You don’t know how they relate to each other.
      You don’t know what you’re actually buying.
    </p>

    <h2>A different way to play</h2>

    <p>
      LotteryDesigner does not predict outcomes and does not guarantee winnings.
      Instead, it helps you <strong>understand the structure</strong>
      behind number combinations.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>See how combinations relate to each other</li>
      <li>Control coverage instead of relying on blind randomness</li>
      <li>Decide how much you play — and why</li>
    </ul>
